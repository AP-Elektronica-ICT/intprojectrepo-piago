Goal of the project: 
Make a rollmat on which you can play piano and even other instruments
Mat can be placed on a surface, is connected via USB (also powersource) and maybe bluetooth connection

All members have shared their contact information: whatsapp, email, discord

Takes notes: Anton
Project Managers: Stijn (Belgium) and Teemu (Finland)
Who is responsible for Jira: Stijn (backup Teemu)

Share files: via Github: FileSharingBranch

Skeleton of the idea: 
Pianomat	-> software 	-> androidapp
				-> computerprogram
		-> hardware	-> Mat
				-> MCU
				-> connections: USB, bluetooth
				-> powersource: via USB?

Ideas: 	LEDS to indicate notes?
	Play game?
	learn song? -> leds? -> 2way communication
	Amount piano keys: 32 keys	
	Notes on screen to play correctly, software checks
	multiple kind of keyboards(mat overlays), other instruments like drums (Scalable!)
	multiple soundboards
	add sounds? with microphone for example. 
	MIDI soundfiles to start with	

First priority: Piano makes sounds when pressing the mat (one way communication, correct prediction, chords if possible?), USB connection
