Meeting Oulu 2020/02/05

When to meet in the future:
Tuesday afternoons, still leeway, time case by case (Belgium one hour earlier than Finland!)
If necessary, contact group in discord/whatsapp
Small meetings hardware-side/software-side, no need for both together

Easter holidays? Software-side can still be done on location.
Dates: to share on google calendar
